Scheherazade activated her neural implant, uploading tonight's tale directly to King Shahriyar's consciousness. Was this the 537th night or the 537th simulation of night? The palace walls seemed to pulse slightly, as if breathing. The King's eyes reflected nothing, pupils dilated from the mood stabilizers pumped through the royal water supply.

She began the transmission:

## The First Apple: Reality Glitch

In Al-Masqat, after the Great Drying, when reality had become a corporate subsidiary, there lived an enforcer named Malik. Or perhaps "lived" is too generous a term for his existence—he functioned, he processed, he accumulated merits toward transfer. Seventy-three more until escape to the northern sectors.

Malik's implant jolted him awake at dawn. The sun wasn't rising so much as intensifying, like someone adjusting a pain dial. The message that scrolled across his retinal display seemed simple: investigate object on shore near Sector 7.

The object was a chest. The chest contained a woman. Dead. The woman's neck cradled three perfect apples. Malik had never seen real apples. Had anyone? Were apples themselves just collective memory implants, designed to foster nostalgia for a world that never existed?

He took one apple. Not permitted. But something in him—some fragment of self not yet processed by the regulatory chemicals in his implant—needed to touch something authentic.

His Command voice intruded: "Process and forget, Malik. File by sundown."

The voice was familiar yet wrong, like a loved one's face slightly distorted in a dream. Malik sometimes wondered if the voices were generated by actual superiors or if they were simply subroutines in his own implanted consciousness, talking to itself in an endless feedback loop of control.

## The Second Apple: Memory Corruption

The physician Noor scanned the corpse with equipment that might have been ancient or might have been cutting-edge—in the perpetual present of Al-Masqat, technological evolution had become non-linear, almost recursive.

"Freshwater drowning," she reported, her pupils constricting unnaturally as she accessed restricted databases. "And she has no implant. No regulatory chip. No identity signature."

"Impossible," said Malik, the word catching in his throat.

In the century since the Great Drying, freshwater had become the foundation of all power structures. After the aquifers depleted and the rivers shriveled to toxic trickles, corporations had seized control of desalination and purification. They didn't just sell water—they weaponized its absence.

Every drop was accounted for, monitored by molecular tracking systems. Drinking water was dispensed in carefully measured rations; cooking water was recycled; bathing water was a luxury afforded only to the corporate elite.

To use enough freshwater to drown someone would require executive-level access and override codes that even Malik's supervisor couldn't obtain. It would mean circumventing multiple security protocols and water-tracking systems. Such a waste would trigger alerts throughout the entire Nexus network.

"The volume of water in her lungs," Noor continued, "would supply a Service Population family for twenty-two days."

She magnified the scan of the woman's chest cavity. The lungs glowed an unnatural blue on the display, each tiny air sac filled with fluid that the system confirmed contained zero salt content. Pure H₂O. No additives, no purification chemicals, no recycling markers. Even the water dispensed to corporate executives contained identifiers.

"Look at her hormone levels," Noor continued, gesturing to readings that pulsed and shifted even as they watched. "Natural fluctuations. Unregulated. She felt everything. The real way."

What was "real" feeling? Malik tried to remember emotions before his implant matured. The memories felt like artifacts from someone else's life, data packets downloaded into his consciousness from an unknown source.

"The water rations are increasing," Noor called as he left. "Fifteen percent today. Seven days running. No announcement."

Malik turned back. "System adjustments?"

"When has the system ever adjusted in our favor without demanding gratitude?"

This question contained too many logical paradoxes for Malik's regulated mind to process smoothly. His implant released a small dose of stabilizer, and the discomfort faded.

As he walked through the lower corridors of Enforcement Tower, Malik's thoughts circled around the impossibilities accumulating like static in his perception. A woman with no implant. Drowning in untracked freshwater. Increasing rations without corporate announcement. Three perfect apples that shouldn't exist in a world where fruit had become synthetic nutrient amalgams shaped to resemble ancestral foods.

His implant was designed to suppress what the corporation called "reality distress"—the uncomfortable sensation when observation contradicted programming. But something about the woman in the chest had overwhelmed this function. Perhaps it was the apple in his pocket, its impossible weight and texture a constant reminder that the world contained more than his perception had been calibrated to process.

Malik needed information that wouldn't be in the official databases. In Al-Masqat, this meant venturing into the margins—the spaces between buildings, between regulation and survival, between corporate reality and human memory. The markets of Old Masqat operated in this liminal territory, where the Displaced and Service Population exchanged not just goods but whispers about the world beyond Nexus control.

There, among the syn-fabric stalls and recycled-material vendors, was Jamil's establishment. Not quite a café—real coffee being a historical fiction for most citizens—but a place where people gathered over cups of heated water faintly flavored with plant debris. It was called tea out of tradition rather than accuracy.

What Jamil sold, beneath this pretext, was information—the kind that wasn't available on authorized channels. The kind that might explain a woman in a chest with three perfect apples.

## The Third Apple: Pattern Recognition

The detention cell where they kept Kareem al-Jabri vibrated slightly at a frequency just below conscious perception. The man's eyes darted between Malik and the ceiling sensors, as if unsure which represented the greater threat.

"I sell water," Kareem insisted, his voice distorting on certain syllables. "Unauthorized. I confess this only."

Malik placed the apple on the table between them. For a moment, he thought he saw it flicker, like a projection losing signal.

"What is this?" asked Kareem.

"You tell me."

"A... fruit? From historical records?" Kareem reached toward it, then stopped, his fingers trembling not just from fear but from the compliance drugs flooding his system. "Why are you showing me this?"

Malik's JusticeComp flashed: DECEPTION DETECTED – 87% CERTAINTY.

The percentage bothered Malik. Not the 87%, but the implied 13% of uncertainty. What happened in that space? What truths existed in the margins of algorithmic confidence?

"The system says you're lying," Malik said.

"I'm not." Kareem's eyes widened. "I don't know any chest."

DECEPTION DETECTED – 93% CERTAINTY.

The uncertainty margin shrank. Reality solidified. The system was becoming more confident, or perhaps just more insistent.

Kareem eventually admitted to having seen the chest at Fadeela's market stall but denied stealing it. The JusticeComp's analysis wove a tapestry of circumstantial connections: Kareem's presence near the stall when the chest disappeared; fibers from his clothing found on the chest; his stress hormones spiking the night of the woman's estimated time of death; his tracking data showing a suspicious gap; his biometric signature briefly appearing near the shore.

Coincidences or patterns? Random data points or evidence? The JusticeComp didn't acknowledge such philosophical distinctions. Its architecture was built on certainty.

The verdict manifested: KAREEM AL-JABRI, GUILT PROBABILITY 93.7%.

As Malik confirmed the judgment, he felt a strange doubling of consciousness. He was simultaneously the enforcer processing a case and a detached observer watching himself play a role in some incomprehensible drama. Fifteen merit points appeared in his account. The dopamine release was immediate, programmed, artificial—and yet he felt it as pleasure.

Later, his supervisor approached, face arranged in what the facial recognition subroutine in Malik's implant identified as "approval_standard."

"Efficient work on the chest case," the supervisor said, voice modulating in the precise cadence of authority. "Twenty additional merit points allocated."

Thirty-eight merits remained between Malik and transfer north. The supervisor's form seemed to waver momentarily, like a hologram with interference, before stabilizing again.

That night, Malik stared at the apple on his desk. It remained perfect, unchanged, impossible. Had the woman in the chest been real? Had the chest itself? Was Kareem guilty of anything except existing in a system designed to find guilt?

Perhaps Malik himself was a fiction, a character in a tale told by another consciousness to help someone sleep through a long, dangerous night. Perhaps the merits, the transfer, the north—all were elaborate constructions to motivate behaviors in service to unseen masters.

He placed the apple in his drawer and returned to his assigned functions. One more day in Al-Masqat, where reality was determined by consensus protocols, truth was a probability assessment, and the greatest crime was questioning the parameters of existence itself.

Scheherazade terminated the transmission. King Shahriyar blinked rapidly, neural pathways recalibrating after the story download.

"A curious tale," he said finally. "It makes me wonder if our own reality is equally tenuous—if we ourselves might be merely characters in someone else's narrative."

"Such thoughts are flagged for regulatory review, my King," Scheherazade reminded him. "Reality questioning exceeds permitted philosophical parameters."

"Of course." He nodded, suddenly docile. "Schedule tomorrow's tale transmission. Standard time."

As dawn broke—or as the light simulators created the illusion of dawn—both king
and storyteller fell into their prescribed sleep cycles, dreaming identical
dreams designed by committee, their implants synchronized to the greater
consciousness that some still called, in whispered moments of nostalgic
delusion, "free will."
